# Installation
If you don't have python installed just download and run the executable (that'll be the .exe file).

The other file is the source code (and this readme file)
you can run the python file if you have python installed as well as any of the libraries it uses.

# Use
once you run it it will prompt you to give it a url to get images from and after grabing all those images it will ask you for a name to give to the files (they will be named in the fassion of name0 name1 name2 etc)

the images will be put into the same folder as the executable/python file so make sure it's in a place you want that/make a specific folder to put it in.
